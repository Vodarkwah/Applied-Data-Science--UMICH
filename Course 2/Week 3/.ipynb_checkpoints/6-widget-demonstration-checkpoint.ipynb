    "# Widget Demonstration\n",
    "This lecture is a bit different, it's an extended topic that looks at the interactive functionality which is available within Jupyter. Jupyter has a notion of widgets, which allow you to build simple dashboards within notebooks to aid in your investigation. You can read more about the Jupyter widgets here, and please keep in mind that while everything I'm showing should work fine in your coursera system, it's quite likely that this fast moving world is already a bit out of date with the very latest!: https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"
